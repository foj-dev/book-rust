## Line break

Line breaks are used when you want to improve text formatting.
- **println!:** used to print something and then move to a new line.
- **\n:** used to insert a new line character anywhere within the text.

```rust
// line break: \n
println!("What is your name?\nMy name is Rodolfo!");

println!("");

// It allows the visualization of (\n): \\n
println!("What is your name?\\nMy name is Rodolfo!");
```
